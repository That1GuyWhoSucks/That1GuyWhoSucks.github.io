<p>I made a chatbot</p>
<img src="/assets/pizzamsg.png" alt="">
<p>Hes not very smart but he slowly learned. He could also use a voice chat and respond through voice</p>
<pre><code>async def speak(self):
time = tim.perf_counter()
print(self.backlog)
self.chat = True
while self.chat:
    print("in mian")
    if time < tim.perf_counter() and len(self.backlog) > 0:
        print("respone")
        gTTS(text=self.backlog.pop(0), lang="en", slow=False).save("respone.mp3")
        self.vc.play(discord.FFmpegPCMAudio("respone.mp3"))
        time = MP3("respone.mp3").info.length + tim.perf_counter()
    else:
        await asyncio.sleep(1)</code></pre>
<p>This is just his speaking function, the listening part is nearly identical to one used in my <a href="/voiceassist.html">Voice assistant</a></p>

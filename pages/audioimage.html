<p>This project converts images to audio and vice versa.</p>
<p>Example image below.</p>
<div class="imgcut">
    <img src="/assets/zoomedNGGYU.png" alt="">
</div>
<p>Each pixel holds a value that represents the audio at that moment as gathered by PyDub. 
    The audio used to create this was 300 seconds long and it encoded to be 6381 by 6381 pixels.
    It can be thought of as like a QR code, except instead of taking you to a webpage it is the raw data.
    My next goal for this project is to make a compression system that can also be stored in the image to reduce file size.</p>

    <pre><code class="center">def split(val: int, size=2):

        elif len(item) == 2 and item[0] == "0":
            item = "20" + str(item[1])
        ret.append(int(item))
        st = st[size:]
    while len(ret) < 3:
        ret.append(0)
    return ret</code></pre>

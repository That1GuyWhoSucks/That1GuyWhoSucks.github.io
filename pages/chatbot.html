<p>I made a chatbot</p>
<img src="/assets/pizzamsg.png" alt="">
<p>This is just his speaking function, the listening part is nearly identical to one used in my <a href="/pages/voiceassist.html">Voice assistant.</a>
    It is used in a discord bot so people can talk to my bot and it can talk back.</p>
<pre><code>async def speak(self):
time = tim.perf_counter()
self.chat = True
while self.chat:
    if time < tim.perf_counter() and len(self.backlog) > 0:
        gTTS(text=self.backlog.pop(0), lang="en", slow=False).save("respone.mp3")
        self.vc.play(discord.FFmpegPCMAudio("respone.mp3"))
        time = MP3("respone.mp3").info.length + tim.perf_counter()
    else:
        await asyncio.sleep(1)</code></pre>

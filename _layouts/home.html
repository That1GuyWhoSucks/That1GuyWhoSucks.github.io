    <h1>Howdy</h1>
    <p>This is just a site to link a few AL projects that may be of use. Basically there is a full simulator (WIP) made in Unity to completely recreate the game, yell at me on discord if you are interested are have any insights to the code. Then there is the general math tool which is linked below. It's a bit large so sorry about that.</p>
